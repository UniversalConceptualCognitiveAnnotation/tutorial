\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This is an introductory tutorial to UCCA (Universal Conceptual Cognitive Annotation), a cross-linguistically applicable framework for semantic representation, with corpora annotated in English, German and French, and ongoing annotation in Russian and Hebrew. UCCA builds on extensive typological work and supports rapid annotation. The tutorial will provide a detailed introduction to the UCCA annotation guidelines, design philosophy and the available resources; and a comparison to other meaning representations. It will also survey the existing parsing work, including the findings of three recent shared tasks, in SemEval and CoNLL, that addressed UCCA parsing. Finally, the tutorial will present recent applications and extensions to the scheme, demonstrating its value for natural language processing in a range of languages and domains.
\end{abstract}


\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

Universal Conceptual Cognitive Annotation \cite[UCCA;][]{abend2013universal} 
is a symbolic meaning representation (MR)
that supports human annotation of text with broad coverage.
While several meaning representation schemes share this goal
\citep{abend2017state}, UCCA targets a level of semantic granularity that abstracts away from syntactic paraphrases in a typologically-motivated, cross-linguistic fashion, building on Basic Linguistic Theory \citep{Dixon:basic}, an influential framework for linguistic description.
The scheme does not rely on language-specific resources, and sets a low
threshold for annotator training.

UCCA has been annotated on several corpora of different genres and
languages,\footnote{\scriptsize\url{https://github.com/UniversalConceptualCognitiveAnnotation}} as summarized in \cref{tab:data}.
Pilot studies have been conducted in additional languages.
A web-based annotation system is available \cite{abend2017uccaapp}.

In UCCA, an analysis of a text passage is a directed acyclic graph
over semantic elements called \textit{units}.
The principal kind of unit is a \textit{scene},
which describes an action, movement or state, and is similar to FrameNet's notion of a {\it frame}.
\Cref{fig:ex} contains three scenes, evoked, respectively,
by the verb \textit{took},
the noun phrase \textit{a repair}, and the possessive \textit{our}.
Several elements are exemplified, including participants,
secondary relations, and scene linkage.
The graph is anchored in the text tokens (the leaves generally correspond to one or more tokens), and relations between units
are indicated by the \textit{categories} assigned to the edges connecting them.

The goals of this tutorial are:
to describe the UCCA representation as a linguistic scheme and how it is
being used computationally, especially for cross-lingual and multilingual
NLP; to familiarize participants with existing UCCA parsers and
equip them with the conceptual tools required for desigining new parsers;
and to review existing extensions and possible future directions.

\section{Relevance}\label{sec:relevance}

UCCA resources and applications are valuable for cross-lingual NLP:
like Universal Dependencies \citep{nivre-etal-2020-universal},
UCCA's category set can in principle be applied to a wide variety of languages.
It is also cross-linguistically stable, and reflects a level of semantic structure that is usually preserved in translations \cite{sulem2015conceptual}.
UCCA has been applied in NLP to text simplification \citep{sulem-etal-2018-simple,sulem-etal-2020-semantic},
and text-to-text generation evaluation \citep{birch-etal-2016-hume,marecek-etal-2017-cuni,choshen-abend-2018-automatic,sulem-etal-2018-simple,alvamanchego-etal:2019:easse,xu2020incorporate}.
The tutorial will describe the guidelines and rationale behind UCCA,
helping potential application designers understand what abstractions
it makes.

Significant effort has been devoted to building UCCA parsers
\cite[][among others]{hershcovich2017a,jiang-19,zhang2019broad},
including a SemEval~2019 shared task
on cross-lingual UCCA parsing \citep{hershcovich2019shared},
which had 8 participating teams,
as well as CoNLL~2019 and CoNLL~2020 shared tasks on cross-framework and cross-lingual meaning representation
parsing \cite{Oep:Abe:Haj:19,Oep:Abe:Abz:20},
where 12 and 4 teams, respectively, submitted parsed UCCA graphs.
This tutorial will allow researchers interested in UCCA parsing, and more generally graph parsing, deepen their understanding of the framework, 
and what properties make it unique.
The tutorial will include a brief survey of the various approaches taken by existing parsers, and prepare attendees to work on UCCA parsing themselves.

Furthermore, UCCA parsing has been shown to benefit from multi-task learning
\cite{caruana1998multitask}
with other meaning representations \cite{hershcovich2018multitask}, although results from the CoNLL~2019 and CoNLL~2020 shared tasks \cite{Oep:Abe:Haj:19,Oep:Abe:Abz:20}
show that multi-task meaning representation parsing is difficult.
The tutorial will compare and contrast UCCA and other meaning representations,
and will thereby inform participants of the potential advantages and difficulties
in employing multi-task learning across semantic schemes.

UCCA defines a small inventory of coarse-grained categories so as not to rely on language-specific lexical resources, and  can thus in principle be applied to a great variety of languages. This distinguishes UCCA from finer-grained sentence-structural representations like FrameNet \citep{Baker:98}, the Abstract Meaning Representation \citep[AMR;][]{banarescu2013abstract}, which relies on PropBank \citep{Palmer:05},
and Universal Decompositional Semantics \citep[Decomp;][]{white2016universal}.
For example, FrameNet requires a different ontology for each new language addressed \cite{ohara2003japanese,You2005BuildingCF,borin20132,park2014frame,hayoun-elhadad-2016-hebrew,djemaa-etal-2016-corpus},
and AMR underwent significant customization to be applicable to Chinese
\cite{li-etal-2016-annotating}. Decomp takes a different approach to multilinguality, where the parser is required to parse sentences in other languages to their corresponding {\it English} semantic forms \citep{zhang2018cross}.
The tutorial will address contemporary issues in the field, such as
the question of how to represent semantic structure multilingually with
broad coverage, which is actively being explored from many angles.

While UCCA structures and categories are intentionally coarse, the scheme has a multi-layered architecture, which allows for refinement using additional {\it layers}, which serve as ``modules'' of semantic distinctions.
We will give an overview of the recently proposed extensions
(to support coreference) and joint parsing experiments \citep{prange2019made,prange2019semantically}.

\subsection{Prerequisites}\label{sec:prerequisites}

No prior knowledge is assumed about linguistics and typology.
The necessary background will be provided as part of the tutorial.
However, participants are expected to know about basic data structures
such as trees and graphs.
For the parsing section, prior knowledge is assumed about
common machine learning techniques, including supervised learning
and neural networks.
