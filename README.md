# Cross-lingual Semantic Representation for NLP with UCCA: Tutorial at COLING 2020
## Omri Abend, Dotan Dvir, Daniel Hershcovich, Jakob Prange and Nathan Schneider
This is an introductory tutorial to [UCCA (Universal Conceptual Cognitive Annotation)](https://universalconceptualcognitiveannotation.github.io/), a cross-linguistically applicable framework for semantic representation, with corpora annotated in English, German and French, and ongoing annotation in Russian and Hebrew. UCCA builds on extensive typological work and supports rapid annotation. The tutorial will provide a detailed introduction to the UCCA annotation guidelines, design philosophy and the available resources; and a comparison to other meaning representations. It will also survey the existing parsing work, including the findings of three recent shared tasks, in SemEval and CoNLL, that addressed UCCA parsing. Finally, the tutorial will present recent applications and extensions to the scheme, demonstrating its value for natural language processing in a range of languages and domains.

The tutorial will be presented at [COLING 2020](https://coling2020.org/): pre-recorded presentations will be available before the conference, and the live Q&A will take place on December 12th, 2020.
