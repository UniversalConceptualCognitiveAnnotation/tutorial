# Cross-lingual Semantic Representation for NLP with UCCA: Tutorial at COLING 2020
## [Omri Abend](https://www.cse.huji.ac.il/~oabend), Dotan Dvir, [Daniel Hershcovich](http://danielhers.github.io/), [Jakob Prange](https://prange.jakob.georgetown.domains) and [Nathan Schneider](http://nathan.cl)
This is an introductory tutorial to [UCCA (Universal Conceptual Cognitive Annotation)](https://universalconceptualcognitiveannotation.github.io/), a cross-linguistically applicable framework for semantic representation, with corpora annotated in English, German and French, and ongoing annotation in Russian and Hebrew. UCCA builds on extensive typological work and supports rapid annotation. The tutorial provides a detailed introduction to the UCCA annotation guidelines, design philosophy and the available resources; and a comparison to other meaning representations. It also surveys the existing parsing work, including the findings of three recent shared tasks, in SemEval and CoNLL, that addressed UCCA parsing. Finally, the tutorial presents recent applications and extensions to the scheme, demonstrating its value for natural language processing in a range of languages and domains.

The tutorial is presented at [COLING 2020](https://coling2020.org/): pre-recorded presentations are available on the conference live website (see also [unedited videos](https://github.com/UniversalConceptualCognitiveAnnotation/tutorial/releases/download/coling2020/videos.zip)), and the live Q&A will take place on December 12th, 2020 at 14:30-18:00 CET.

The tutorial contents are available in this repository, including the [abstract](abstract.pdf) and slides.
